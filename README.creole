A pure python ping implementation using raw sockets.

Note that ICMP messages can only be sent from processes running as root
(in Windows, you must run this script as 'Administrator').

== Revision history ==

February 4, 2015
----------------
 * Fix statistics dump on unexpected exit
 * Fixing a bug where we match the ICMP request as respons
	- Fix based on samuel's work https://github.com/samuel/python-ping/commit/745c159dacce6afebb0f82cac8e9ed5bb2189491#diff-0ee81781c0132dc8f743df3a41b71918R128
 * Merging simudream's patch to fix python3 error handeling.


January 21, 2015
----------------
* Set socket options to allow sending pings to broadcast address
  - Based on Tom Wilkie's patch
    https://github.com/tomwilkie/pyping/commit/7d017b03ee462fae72e2d0ff96a042bcba295564

August 6, 2014
--------------
* Fixing an bug introduced with last changes :S
  - Python on Windows dosn't have socket.inet_ntop
    Adding try/except to handle AttributeError.

June 30, 2014
-------------
* For problems/suggestions https://github.com/l4m3rx/python-ping/issues

* Forgot to add stuff to this README :p

June 29, 2014
-------------
* Merging parts of code from all the python-ping forks on github
    * Litlle modifications by Auke Willem Oosterhoff:
    - Added support for simultaneous pings on multiple hosts.
    https://bitbucket.org/OrangeTux/python-ping/commits/d4aa720662995a57cf18fa6b8ea689e9d11d26c7/raw/

    * Faster and cleaner checksum creation
    Based on frfra's patch
    https://github.com/alexlouden/python-ping/commit/b9fc3acb2c36ccc895d1f7ba7336b951dc033ce9

    * Changing 'except' calls to work with 2.x and 3.x
    Based on pferate's patch
    https://github.com/pferate/python_ping/commit/4e761ea99582ac1699c7965d149ce16e6b62f0ac

* Some small PIP8 stuff...

* Merging stuff from/with https://github.com/estemendoza/python-ping
  Both repos are in sync now.

June 19, 2013
--------------
* Added support for IPv6. Taken from implementation of Lars Strand.

March 19, 2013
--------------
* Fixing bug to prevent divide by 0 during run-time.
    
January 26, 2012
----------------
* Fixing BUG #4 - competability with python 2.x [tested with 2.7]
- Packet data building is different for 2.x and 3.x.
'cose of the string/bytes difference.
* Fixing BUG #10 - the multiple resolv issue.
- When pinging domain names insted of hosts (for exmaple google.com)
you can get different IP every time you try to resolv it, we should
resolv the host only once and stick to that IP.
* Fixing BUGs #3 #10 - Doing hostname resolv only once.
* Fixing BUG #14 - Removing all 'global' stuff.
- You should not use globul! Its bad for you...and its not thread safe!
* Fix - forcing the use of different times on linux/windows for
more accurate mesurments. (time.time - linux/ time.clock - windows)
* Adding quiet_ping function - This way we'll be able to use this script
as external lib.
* Changing default timeout to 3s. (1second is not enought)
* Switching data syze to packet size. It's easyer for the user to ignore the
fact that the packet headr is 8b and the datasize 64 will make packet with

==== Oct. 17, 2011 ====
--------------
* [[https://github.com/jedie/python-ping/pull/6|Bugfix if host is unknown]]

==== Oct. 12, 2011 ====
--------------
Merge sources and create a seperate github repository:
* https://github.com/jedie/python-ping

Add a simple CLI interface.

==== September 12, 2011 ====
--------------
* Bugfixes + cleanup by Jens Diemer
	Tested with Ubuntu + Windows 7

==== September 6, 2011 ====
--------------
* [[http://www.falatic.com/index.php/39/pinging-with-python|Cleanup by Martin Falatic.]]
Restored lost comments and docs. Improved functionality: constant time between
pings, internal times consistently use milliseconds. Clarified annotations
(e.g., in the checksum routine). Using unsigned data in IP & ICMP header
pack/unpack unless otherwise necessary. Signal handling. Ping-style output
formatting and stats.

==== August 3, 2011 ====
--------------
* Ported to py3k by Zach Ware. Mostly done by 2to3; also minor changes to
	deal with bytes vs. string changes (no more ord() in checksum() because
	>source_string< is actually bytes, added .encode() to data in
	send_one_ping()).  That's about it.

==== March 11, 2010 ====
--------------
* changes by Samuel Stauffer:
	replaced time.clock with default_timer which is set to
	time.clock on windows and time.time on other systems.

==== November 8, 2009 ====
--------------
* Fixes by [[http://www.g-loaded.eu/2009/10/30/python-ping/|George Notaras]],
	reported by [[http://cdhallman.blogspot.com|Chris Hallman]]: 

* Improved compatibility with GNU/Linux systems.

* Changes in this release:
	Re-use time.time() instead of time.clock(). The 2007 implementation
	worked only under Microsoft Windows. Failed on GNU/Linux.
	time.clock() behaves differently under [[http://docs.python.org/library/time.html#time.clock|the two OSes]].


==== May 30, 2007 ====
--------------
little [[http://www.python-forum.de/post-69122.html#69122|rewrite by Jens Diemer]]:
 * change socket asterisk import to a normal import
 * replace time.time() with time.clock()
 * delete "return None" (or change to "return" only)
 * in checksum() rename "str" to "source_string"

==== December 4, 2000 ====
--------------
* Changed the struct.pack() calls to pack the checksum and ID as
	unsigned. My thanks to Jerome Poincheval for the fix.

==== November 22, 1997 ====
--------------
* Initial hack. Doesn't do much, but rather than try to guess
	what features I (or others) will want in the future, I've only
	put in what I need now.

==== December 16, 1997 ====
For some reason, the checksum bytes are in the wrong order when
this is run under Solaris 2.X for SPARC but it works right under
Linux x86. Since I don't know just what's wrong, I'll swap the
bytes always and then do an htons().
